### Conway's Game of Life 
https://airmoor.github.io/game-of-life/ 

You can create random fields or select cells yourself.

#### Rules 
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
